# Asymmetrik-Business-Card-OCR
Business card text as input and outputs the Name, Phone, and Email.

I created this program using Python 3.8 and utilized tkinter to assist with the GUI.
This program can take in either a string or text file.
You can easily run this through a command prompt (python may be required).
